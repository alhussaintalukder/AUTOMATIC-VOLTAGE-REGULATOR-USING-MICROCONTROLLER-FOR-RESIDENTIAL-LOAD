# AUTOMATIC-VOLTAGE-REGULATOR-USING-MICROCONTROLLER-FOR-RESIDENTIAL-LOAD
Thesis Project
The project titled "Automatic Voltage Regulator using Microcontroller for Residential Load" aimed to design and implement an automated voltage regulation system for single phase power supply. The system was designed using ATmega328P microcontroller and a multi-tap single-phase step-up transformer. The proposed system monitored the voltage level and adjusted it to the desired value by switching between different taps on the transformer. The results showed that the system was able to regulate the voltage effectively, maintaining it within the specified limits, even under varying load conditions. The system was tested and validated through experiments, and the results showed that it was able to provide a stable voltage output, ensuring the protection of connected electrical appliances and improving their performance. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates the effectiveness of using a microcontroller-based approach for automatic voltage regulation, offering a low-cost, efficient and reliable solution for single phase power supply systems.
